# dotfiles

A fork of holman's awesome dotfiles repository for sharing my development environment settings with others and making provisioning a new computer a breeze. Always WIP.

## Setup

I typically clone this into ~/.dotfiles. From there, run `script/install` to install any dependencies and `script/bootstrap` to bootstrap the machine with configuration files. For updates, simply `git pull` and run those two commands again.
